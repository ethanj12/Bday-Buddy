# BirthdayApp
I can be a bad friend sometimes. I forget birthdays all of the time. It started to become a joke among my friend group. I decided to no longer be the man who forgot birthdays.  
  
The purpose of this app is to organize and notify the user of any upcoming birthdays for their friends. The user inputs their friend's birthday and a notification is
scheduled for 8:00am local time to notify the user of their friend's birthday. The user is also able to search for their friend's birthday, make notes on their birthday wishes, 
and add their photo.
